      Raju: Raju is a daring, and mischievous 4-year old boy, he is a bald
      toddler with only two strands of hair on his head who wears nothing but
      his blue underpants. (Voiced by Julie Tejwani) Raju's size belies his
      courage, which he gets from his father, commander of the King's army. Raju
      also wants to be the commander of the Army. He is a prodigy at archery and
      has won the "Arjuna Cup". Raju is also very articulate and intelligent for
      his age, being able to converse and follow along with his older friends on
      their adventures with no difficulty.
