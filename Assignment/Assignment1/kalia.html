      Kalia: Kalia is an envious bully. He is 10-years old and depicted as an
      ambitious boy who is always outshone by Bheem. He has two fearful lackeys,
      Dholu and Bholu, twin brothers who sometimes help him with his plans and,
      at other times, quickly abandon him. He often blows his own trumpet by
      claiming he is the strongest and most courageous person. Whenever any
      problem arises, he runs away. Despite his competitive personality, he also
      helps the gang out for important matters (such as an attack on Dholakpur)
      and will put aside his own rivalries and pride for the greater good. And
      whenever he witnesses Bheem's other rivalry with Kichak, he'll often show
      support towards Bheem. He is depicted as a tall and overweight boy wearing
      only a short tied-up grey dhoti and lots of gold jewellery.
