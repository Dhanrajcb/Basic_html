      Chhota Bheem: Chhota Bheem is the main protagonist of the show. He is a
      9-year old young boy. Bheem is an adventurous, fun-loving but virtuous boy
      who is gifted with superhuman strength. This strength can be powered up by
      consuming ladoos, his favourite food. Bheem appears bare-chested, wearing
      an orange dhoti and a gold pendant. He has brown hair. (Voiced by Sonal
      Kaushal) His power is a boon for his village, Dholakpur, which is
      constantly beset by all kinds of problems. Bheem is beloved and respected
      by the village for being kind and using his strength to help those who are
      poor, wronged, or needy, and may be considered a little guardian of the
      villagers and the animals in and around Dholakpur. Bheem is often seen
      defeating enemies who attack Dholakpur or harm the villagers, like the
      evil demon Kirmada, the robber Mangal Singh, and the evil witch. Having
      gained King Indraverma's trust, Bheem discusses the village issues with
      the ministers of the kingdom. Being intelligent and strong he represents
      Dholakpur in various matters and competitions.
