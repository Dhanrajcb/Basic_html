      Chutki: Chutki is a young 7-year old girl and the daughter of Tuntun
      Mausi, the sweet-maker. She often helps Bheem sneak ladoos from her
      mother's shop. Chutki is the brains of the team. She's depicted as
      fair-skinned having pink blush applied on her cheeks wearing a purple
      floral lehenga and has her brown hair in twin braids. Her name means young
      or little one. (Voiced by Rupa Bhimani) Chutki is Bheem's closest friend
      and he often relies on her to solve any puzzles or difficult situations
      with her intelligence. On many occasions, she is shown to have a crush on
      Bheem. She first met Bheem, Raju and Jaggu when Bheem saved her from a
      raging bull. While she is responsible for her household chores and gentle
      towards all people and other creatures, she can be tough when the
      situation demands it. In many episodes and the film Chhota Bheem: Master
      of Shaolin: The Movie, she is depicted as being good at martial arts.
      Chutki frequently supplies Bheem with ladoos on missions to boost his
      strength.
