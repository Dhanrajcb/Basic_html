      Dholu and Bholu: Dholu and Bholu are identical twins and followers of
      Kalia. Though they are not strong themselves, they bask in Kalia's
      strength. Despite their support for a bully, they have kind hearts and
      have also won a trophy for their close brotherhood. But sometimes, they
      argue among themselves and get scolded by Kalia. They are differentiated
      by their clothing, each twin wears a similar set of olive green and brown
      turban, t-shirt and pants with opposite colouring.
